      </p>
      <h4> 2. DRUGS AND MEDICATION:</h4>
      <p> Iunderstand that antibiotics, analgesics and other medicataions can cause allergic reactions
         causing sadness and swelling od tissue, pain, itching, vomiting, and/or anaphylactic shock.
      </p>
      <h4> 3. CHANGES IN TREATMENT PLAN:</h4>
      <p> I understand that during treatment it may be necessary to change or add procedures 
         because of condition found while working on the teth that were not discovered during examination. for example, root 
         canal theraphy following routine restorative procedures. I give my permission to my dentisit to make any/all changes and 
         additions as necessary. 
      </p>
      <h4> 4. REMOVAL TEETH:</h4>
      <p> Alternatives to removal have been explained to me (root canal theraphy, crowns, 
         periodontal surgery, etc.) And i authorize the dentist to remove the following teeth:                                          
         any others necessary for reasons i paragraph #3. I understand removing teeth does not always remove the infection, 
         if precent , and it may be necessary to have further treatment . I understand the risks invovled in having teeth removed, 
         some of wich are pain, welling,spread of infection, dry socket , and loss of feeling in my teeth, lips, tongue, and surrounding tissue
         (paresthesia) that can last for an indefinite period of time or fractured jaw. I understand i may ned further treatment by a specialist if complications arise 
         during or following treatment , the cost for which is my responsibility. 
      </p>
      <h4> 5. CROWMNS, BRIDGES, AND CAPS:</h4>
      <p>I understand that sometimes it is not possible to match the color of natural teeth exactly 
         with artificial teeth. I further understand taht i may be wearing temporary crowns, which may come off easily and that i must
         be careful to ensure that they are kept on until the permanent crowns are delivered. I realize the final opportunity to make
         changes in my new crown bridge, or cap(including shape, fit, and color) will be before cementation. It is also my responsibility
         to return for permanent cementation within 21 days from tooth preparation. excessive delays may llow for tooth movement this may necessitate a remake of the crowns , bridge, or cap. 
         I understand that there will be additional charges for remakes this may delaying  permanent cementation. 
      </p>
      <h4> 6. ENDODONTIC TREATMENT (ROOT CANAL): </h4>
      <p>I realize there is no guarantee that root canal therapy will save my tooth, and 
         that complications can occur from treatment, and that occasionally root canal filling materail may extend through the tooth 
         which does not necessarily effect the succerr of the treatment. I understand that endodontic files are very fine instruments 
         and stresses from their manufacture can cause them seperate during use. I understand that occasionally additional surgical 
         procedures may benecessary following root canal treatment(apicoectomy). I understand that the tooth may be lost in sprite of all efforts to save it.
      </p>
      <h4> 7. PERIODONTAL LOSS(TISSUE AND BONE):</h4>
      <p>I understand that i have a serious condition, causing gum and bone inflamation
         or loss and that it can to the loss of my teeth. Alternative treatment plans have been explained to me, including gum 
         surgery, replacement and/or extractions. I understand that undertaking any dental procedure may have a future adverse effect on my periodontal condition. 
      </p>
      <h4> 8. FILLINGS:</h4>
      <p> I understand that care must be exercising in chewing of fillings especially during the first 24 hours to avoid breakage. I unerstand that a more extensive filling than originally diagnosed
         may be required due to additional decay. I understand that significant sensivity is a common after effect of a newly placed filling. 
      </p>
      <h4> 9. DENTURES:</h4>
      <p> I understand that wearing of dentures is difficult. Score sports, altered speech, and difficulty in eating are some common problems. Immediate dentures(placement of denture immediately after extractions) may be painful. Immediate 
         dentures may require considerable adjusting and several relines. A permanent reline will be needed later. This is not include in the denture fee.
         I understand that it is my resposibility to return for delivery appoinment may result in poorly fitted dentures. If remake is required due to my delays of 30 days, there will be additional
         charges. 
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>I understand that the dentistry in not an exact science and that therefore, reputable practitioners cannot properly guarentee result.
         I acknowledge that no guarantee or assurance has been made by any regarding the dental treatment which i have rquested and authorized.
      </p>
      <p>I hereby authorize any of the doctors or dental auxiliaries to proceed with and perform the dental restopration and treatment as 
         explained to me.I understand that this is only as estemate and subject to modification depending on unforeseen or undiagosable 
         circumstances that may arise during the course of treatment. I understand that regardless of any dental insurance coverage I may have, I am
